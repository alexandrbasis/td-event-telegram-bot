## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Tres Dias Israel - Telegram Bot  
**Business Domain**: Event Management & Participant Registration  
**Primary Purpose**: Automate participant registration and management for Tres Dias Israel religious retreats  
**Target Users**: Event coordinators, administrators, and authorized viewers  

### Mission Statement
Provide an intelligent, user-friendly Telegram bot that streamlines participant registration for Tres Dias Israel events, eliminates manual data entry errors, prevents duplicate registrations, and maintains data integrity across multiple backend systems.

## Business Context

### What is Tres Dias?
Tres Dias is a Christian spiritual retreat movement that conducts 3-day intensive programs. The Israeli chapter requires:
- Careful participant screening and registration
- Role-based access control for sensitive participant data
- Multi-language support (Russian, English, Hebrew context)
- Integration with existing workflow tools (Airtable, local databases)

### Business Pain Points Addressed
1. **Manual Data Entry**: Coordinators previously copied participant data manually from messages
2. **Data Inconsistency**: Different formats and typos led to database inconsistencies  
3. **Duplicate Participants**: No automated checking for existing participants
4. **Access Control**: Need to restrict sensitive operations to authorized coordinators
5. **Multi-Backend Complexity**: Supporting both cloud (Airtable) and local databases
6. **Hebrew Text Issues**: Hebrew characters causing parsing errors in participant data

## Core Business Entities

### Participant
The central business entity representing a person applying for or participating in Tres Dias events.

**Core Attributes:**
- **FullNameRU** (Required): Full name in Russian/Cyrillic script
- **Gender** (Required): M (Male) / F (Female) - required for accommodation planning
- **Size** (Required): Clothing size (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, 3XL) - for event materials
- **Church** (Required): Home church/congregation - for community tracking
- **Role** (Required): CANDIDATE (first-time participant) / TEAM (returning helper)

**Optional Attributes:**
- **Department**: For TEAM role - specific service area (Kitchen, Worship, Administration, etc.)
- **FullNameEN**: English transliteration of name
- **CountryAndCity**: Location information (focus on Israeli cities)
- **SubmittedBy**: Name of person who referred/submitted this participant
- **ContactInformation**: Email, phone, or other contact details

**Business Rules:**
- FullNameRU is the primary identifier for duplicate detection
- Department is only applicable when Role = "TEAM"
- Gender determines accommodation assignments
- Size determines material distribution
- Church affiliation is tracked for community building

### User Roles
**Coordinator**: Full access - can add, edit, delete participants
**Viewer**: Read-only access - can view participant lists and statistics

## User Roles & Permissions

### Coordinator Role
**Who**: Event organizers, registration managers, senior volunteers  
**Permissions**:
- Add new participants (`/add` command)
- Edit existing participant data (`/edit` command - planned)
- Delete participants (`/delete` command - planned)  
- View all participant data (`/list` command)
- Export data (`/export` command - planned)
- Access all bot functionality

**Business Justification**: Coordinators handle sensitive personal data and make decisions about participant acceptance.

### Viewer Role  
**Who**: Junior volunteers, observers, reporting personnel  
**Permissions**:
- View participant lists (`/list` command)
- Access basic bot help (`/help`, `/start`)
- Export data (`/export` command - planned)

**Restrictions**:
- Cannot add, modify, or delete participant data
- Cannot access administrative functions

**Business Justification**: Allows broader team access for coordination while protecting data integrity.

### Unauthorized Users
**Behavior**: Denied access with clear error message  
**Business Justification**: Participant data is sensitive and requires explicit authorization.

## Business Processes

### 1. Participant Registration Process

**Trigger**: Coordinator receives participant information (via email, form, verbal communication)  
**Goal**: Accurately capture participant data in the system  

**Process Flow:**
1. **Initiation**: Coordinator uses `/add` command
2. **Data Input**: Coordinator pastes participant information in any supported format:
   - **Template Format**: Structured "Field: Value" format
   - **Free-form Text**: Natural language with participant details
   - **Mixed Format**: Combination of structured and unstructured data
3. **Intelligent Parsing**: System extracts structured data using AI-powered parsing
4. **Validation & Confirmation**: System displays parsed data for coordinator review
5. **Interactive Editing**: Coordinator can modify any field using inline keyboards
6. **Duplicate Detection**: System checks for existing participants by name
7. **Duplicate Resolution**: If duplicate found, coordinator chooses:
   - Create new entry (allow duplicate)
   - Cancel registration
   - Update existing participant data
8. **Final Confirmation**: Coordinator confirms final data
9. **Persistence**: Data saved to configured backend (SQLite or Airtable)
10. **Audit Trail**: Action logged for compliance

**Business Rules:**
- All required fields must be filled before saving
- Hebrew text is filtered out during parsing to prevent errors
- Names are used for duplicate detection (case-insensitive)
- Department field only required for TEAM role

### 2. Data Parsing & Normalization Process

**Business Need**: Coordinators receive participant data in various formats from different sources

**Supported Input Formats:**

**Template Format Example:**
```
–ò–º—è (—Ä—É—Å): –ú–∞—Ä–∏—è –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞  
–ü–æ–ª: F  
–†–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä: M  
–¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å: –ù–æ–≤–∞—è –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å  
–†–æ–ª—å: CANDIDATE  
–ö—Ç–æ –ø–æ–¥–∞–ª: –ü–µ—Ç—Ä –°–∏–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤  
–ö–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç—ã: maria@mail.ru  
```

**Free-form Text Example:**
```
–ê–Ω–Ω–∞ –ö–æ–∑–ª–æ–≤–∞ –∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π S –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –≤–æ—Ä—à–∏–ø –æ—Ç –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–∞ anna@mail.ru
```

**Parsing Intelligence:**
- **Multi-language Recognition**: Handles Russian, English, and mixed text
- **Context-aware Field Detection**: Recognizes fields based on surrounding context
- **Flexible Value Mapping**: Maps display names to system values (e.g., "–∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π" ‚Üí "F")
- **Smart Name Extraction**: Separates Russian and English names from mixed text
- **Contact Information Detection**: Extracts emails, phones automatically
- **Church Name Recognition**: Matches against known church database
- **City Recognition**: Identifies Israeli cities in multiple languages

### 3. Duplicate Management Process

**Business Problem**: Multiple coordinators might register the same participant

**Detection Logic:**
- Primary key: FullNameRU (case-insensitive comparison)
- Fuzzy matching for slight variations in spelling
- Real-time checking during registration

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Add as New**: Create duplicate entry (for different events or genuine different people)
2. **Cancel**: Abort registration process
3. **Replace**: Update existing participant with new data

**Business Value**: Prevents data pollution and maintains participant database integrity

### 4. Role-based Data Access Process

**Business Need**: Control access to sensitive participant information

**Implementation:**
- User ID-based role assignment in configuration
- Decorator-based permission checking on all sensitive operations
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access attempts
