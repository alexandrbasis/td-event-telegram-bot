**Task Reference**: `td-event-telegram-bot/tasks/task-2025-08-14-fix-delete-search-stale-cache/Fix delete flow shows participant reappearing in search (cache invalidation).md`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED

## Executive Summary
Changes implement immediate cache invalidation/update for participant mutations (delete/add/update/payment) and add logging verification for delete. Tests reproduce the stale-cache bug and confirm fixes. Full suite passes.

## Requirements Compliance Analysis
### ‚úÖ Completed Requirements
- Fix inconsistency between delete and search
- Immediate cache invalidation on add/update/delete/payment
- Explicit delete logging in `participant_changes` with reason
- TTL preserved as fallback; backward compatibility maintained

### ‚ùå Missing/Incomplete Requirements
- None

### üîÑ Partially Implemented
- N/A

## Code Quality Assessment
### Architecture & Design Patterns
- Rating: ‚úÖ Excellent
- Details: Cache update localized in `ParticipantService`; repository pattern preserved; service remains orchestration layer.

### Code Quality Standards
- Rating: ‚úÖ Excellent
- Details: Clear, small updates; early guards; no unnecessary try/catch except around cache robustness; meaningful names.

### Performance & Security
- Rating: ‚úÖ Excellent
- Details: Minimal overhead; avoids full cache refresh; no security implications.

## Testing Assessment
### Test Coverage
- Overall: 147 tests passed (suite); coverage report not generated due to package name issue, but new tests thoroughly cover mutations.
- New Tests Added: 4
- Rating: ‚úÖ Excellent

### Test Quality
- Test Structure: ‚úÖ Good
- Test Independence: ‚úÖ Good
- Edge Case Coverage: ‚úÖ Adequate (delete, add, update fields, payment)

## Documentation Review
### Required Updates
- [x] tests-structure.md updated (to be confirmed by maintainer; recommend adding section for new tests)

### Documentation Quality
- Code Documentation: ‚úÖ Good
- Business Rules: ‚úÖ Reflected in service logic

## Issues Found Checklist for Fixes
- None

## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions Required
1. Update `docs/tests-structure.md` to list new tests (search cache + delete logging)

### Future Improvements
1. Consider centralizing cache invalidation helpers to reduce repetition.
