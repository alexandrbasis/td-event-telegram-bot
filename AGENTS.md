## Development Workflow

### **MANDATORY 5-Step Development Process**

All development tasks MUST follow this structured workflow:

#### **Step 1: Task Assignment**
- User provides task description and requirements
- AI Coder agent acknowledges task and begins analysis

#### **Step 2: Technical Decomposition**
- **MANDATORY**: AI Coder agent creates technical decomposition document
- **Location**: `tasks/` directory 
- **Filename**: `task-YYYY-MM-DD-[brief-description].md`
- **Content**: Detailed technical breakdown including:
  - Task overview and business context
  - Technical requirements analysis
  - Implementation steps with checkboxes
  - Dependencies and risks
  - Testing strategy
  - Documentation update plan
  - Estimated effort and timeline

**Technical Decomposition Template:**
```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]

**Created**: [Date]  
**Status**: Draft | Under Review | Approved | In Progress | Completed  
**Estimated Effort**: [Hours/Days]

## Business Context
[Why this task is needed, business value, user impact]

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

## Implementation Steps
### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Step 1.1: [Description]
- [ ] Step 1.2: [Description]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]  
- [ ] Step 2.1: [Description]
- [ ] Step 2.2: [Description]

## Dependencies
- [Dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2]

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: [Description] â†’ **Mitigation**: [Strategy]

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for [component]
- [ ] Integration tests for [workflow]
- [ ] Manual testing scenarios

## Documentation Updates Required
- [ ] Update `patterns.md` (if new patterns)
- [ ] Update `business-requirements.md` (if business rules change)
- [ ] Update `tests-structure.md` (always)
- [ ] Update `project-structure.md` (if structure changes)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

#### **Step 3: Decomposition Review**
- **MANDATORY**: User reviews technical decomposition
- User can request changes, additions, or clarifications
- Process iterates until decomposition is approved
- **Status Update**: Change status from "Draft" to "Approved"

#### **Step 4: Implementation**
- **MANDATORY**: AI Coder agent updates decomposition document throughout implementation
- Mark completed steps with âœ… and timestamp
- Add implementation notes and decisions
- Update status to "In Progress" â†’ "Completed"
- Follow TDD approach: tests first, then implementation
- Maintain real-time progress tracking in the decomposition document

**Progress Tracking Format:**
```markdown
- [x] âœ… Step 1.1: [Description] - Completed [Timestamp]
  - **Implementation Notes**: [Key decisions, challenges, solutions]
- [x] âœ… Step 1.2: [Description] - Completed [Timestamp]
- [ ] Step 1.3: [Description] - In Progress
```

#### **Step 5: Documentation Updates**
- **MANDATORY**: Update all relevant documentation files
- Follow post-implementation requirements
- Update version numbers and dates
- Cross-reference with completed task in decomposition document

### **Workflow Enforcement Rules**

1. **No Implementation Without Decomposition**: Never start coding without an approved technical decomposition
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Update task decomposition throughout implementation, not at the end
3. **Single Source of Truth**: The task decomposition document is the authoritative source for task status
4. **Approval Gate**: Implementation cannot begin until decomposition is explicitly approved by user
5. **Progress Visibility**: User should be able to see progress at any time by checking the task decomposition file

### **Task Decomposition File Management**

- **Archive Completed Tasks**: Move completed task files to `tasks/completed/` subdirectory
- **Naming Convention**: `task-YYYY-MM-DD-[brief-description].md`
- **Status Tracking**: Always maintain current status in document header
- **Cross-References**: Link related tasks and reference relevant documentation
- **Directory Structure**:
  ```
  tasks/
  â”œâ”€â”€ task-2024-12-19-example-feature.md     # Active/In-Progress tasks
  â”œâ”€â”€ task-2024-12-20-another-task.md        # Active/In-Progress tasks
  â””â”€â”€ completed/                              # Completed tasks archive
      â”œâ”€â”€ task-2024-12-15-completed-task.md
      â””â”€â”€ task-2024-12-18-finished-feature.md
  ```
